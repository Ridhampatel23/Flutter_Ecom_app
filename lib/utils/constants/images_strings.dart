///This class contains all Images in String format. Basically when we
///have to use images in our main files, we have to type their whole
///address which is not efficicent. So, in this class we would define
///those image in a String (for example : static const String pfp =
///"assets/logos/pfp.png". This would let us use those images in other
///files without typing the whole address again and again.This also makes
/// it easier incase we have to change an image/logo at multiple locations
/// as it makes the process less repetitive.
